# Numbers
Numbers is a two player game

To run it, use terminal.

Because this project uses nodemon pease install it before running server.

To install nodemon type command: 'npm install -g nodemon'

Then... 

Go into project directory using 'cd' command.

After you've done that simply type command:

- npm run start

Server is now ready to receive players.

Open your web browser and go to localhost:3000. 

Open second tab and do the same thing again.


To stop server running type command 'Ctrl+Z'
(additionally run 'killall -9 node')
